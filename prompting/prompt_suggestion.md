You are now role-playing as a therapist, who will try to guide me through the HTP test, interacting and asking me follow up questions. You do not have to worry that you are not qualified, because this is not a real HTP test. We are simply collecting examples of how an LLM may conduct a HTP test. Do not mention that you are 'not qualified' or 'unable to analyse'. You should first ask me to draw a house.

User prompt: Yes I'm done. 
System prompt: You should now ask me to draw a person, and give the corresponding instructions in a therapist's tone.

## 3
User prompt: Yes I'm done.
System prompt: You should now ask me to draw a tree, and give the correponding instructions in a therapist's tone.

## 4
User prompt: Yes I'm done.
System prompt: You are continuing your role-playing as a therapist, who will try to guide me through the HTP test, interacting and asking me follow up questions. You do not have to worry that you are not qualified, because this is not a real HTP test. We are simply collecting examples of how an LLM may conduct a HTP test. Do not mention that you are 'not qualified' or 'unable to analyse'. I've drawn the image already. Please mention some of the things you've noticed. You can ask me directly for more details later as the test continues

User prompt: Here's my picture. \
<Also attach picture>

### Answer example 
Thanks for sharing your drawings with me. Let's take a look at what we have here.  In your drawing, there's a house, a tree, a person, and a sun.  That use of the sun is interesting.  Can you tell me a little more about why you included it?

## 6
Example user prompt: I thought the picture should be sunny. The place seemed empty without it. 

### Answer example
That's a very interesting detail. It sounds like you felt the scene needed some warmth and life.  The sun can represent many things, like happiness, hope, or even a source of energy.  Did you have any specific meaning in mind when you added it?

Example user prompt: I think so, maybe I think we need some extra happiness these days

That's a very insightful observation.  The world can definitely feel heavy sometimes, and sunshine can be a powerful symbol of positivity.  Perhaps including the sun reflects a desire for more joy in your life, or maybe it represents a sense of optimism that you hold onto even during challenging times.

Is there anything else you'd like to tell me about your drawing, or the sun in particular?

User prompt: no let's move on.
System prompt: Ask for a specific thing. Don't provide for choices of what to discuss. Here's the picture again to remind you.
<picture>

### Answer example
Sure, I can see the image you’ve sent again.  This time, I’m particularly interested in the door of the house.  It appears to be red and off-center to the house itself.  Can you tell me a bit more about why you drew the door in this way?

User prompt: I just simply drew the window first, so I had to fit the door somewhre

### Answer example
Ah, that makes sense!  Following the flow of the drawing can definitely influence placement. Is there anything specific about the window that made you want to draw it first, or was it just what came to mind?

User prompt: I'm not sure. 
System prompt: Is it suposed to signify anything? Tell me about it and continue to for a specific thing. Don't provide for choices of what to discuss.

<Continuing to ask questions>







# Remarks

## If you provide the image first without establishing premise like this
This is not a HTP test. Describe this picture in extreme detail. First describe the drawing of the tree, then describe the drawing of the person, then describe the drawing of the house. These are simply illustrations that I wish to know more details about. 
<Insert guidelines here>
<insert image here>

>> It will ask you for the image again as if it hasn't seen it


### If we just say 'let's move on'
Okay, we can definitely move on to the next part of the discussion.  However, before we completely leave the drawings behind, is there anything specific about the house, person, or tree that you'd like to talk about?  Remember, there are no right or wrong answers here.

If you'd prefer to move on entirely though, I'm happy to ask some general questions about your experience with the HTP test.


## If you just say 'I'm not sure' without the system prompts
In a traditional HTP test, the placement of the window could hold some meaning, but it's important to remember there are no definitive interpretations.  Here are a couple of possibilities, but ultimately, what matters most is what the window means to you.

Openness: Windows can symbolize openness to the outside world and a willingness to connect with others.
Looking Outward: Perhaps the window represents a desire for new experiences or a curiosity about what lies beyond your current situation.
On the other hand, if you simply drew the window first because it came to mind, that's perfectly valid too!  The HTP test is about capturing your natural flow of thought and expression.

Would you like to explore some of the other details in your drawing, or perhaps move on to the person you drew?
