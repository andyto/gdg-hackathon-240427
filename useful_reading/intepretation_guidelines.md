General Interpretive Guidelines
This is from [htp_josephbuck.pdf](htp_josephbuck.pdf)

There are general guidelines that should be taken into consideration when 
evaluating any projective drawing. Regardless of which drawing is being completed, 
the manner in which the task is approached and the way the drawing is presented 
are of equal importance to the content itself. The first step in analyzing the drawing, 
then, is to look the overall picture and evaluate it in the following areas.
