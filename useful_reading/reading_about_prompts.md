### Notes

One of the goals should be to make it NOT say anything about 'not being able to intepret'

You should reject intepretation requests halfway through and only provide answers at the end

Few shot learning - if you see red it means...
If you see x it means...

Things necessary by non-gemini
Bold lines and simple shapes: The use of bold lines and simple shapes for the house, tree, and person suggests a straightforward and practical approach. It could indicate a desire for clarity and a dislike for ambiguity.

Focus on central elements:  Placing the house in the center of the frame and drawing the person directly in the doorway highlights these elements as the focal points. This suggests they hold significant meaning for you.

Lack of details: The absence of details on the windows, door, or person's features could indicate a desire for privacy or a focus on the overall scene rather than specific elements.

Color choices:  The red brick house might represent passion or strong emotions, while the green tree symbolizes growth and stability. It would be interesting to know if there are any other red elements in the drawing, as that could strengthen the idea of passion.

Order of drawing:  If you drew the house first, it could indicate its central importance to your ideal life.  Drawing the person last might suggest you're still figuring out how you fit into this picture.
